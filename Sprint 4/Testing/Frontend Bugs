- not getting the correct result for auction dialog - label instead of password field
- getting tile info result - buttons not correctly assigned
- board moving when rotated - hbox + vbox
- trying to animate the movement of players - using wait doesn't work, and adding the sprites to Nodes doesn't make them show up, solution, show the dice roll then move player
- getting the tiles to show up correctly on the board - problem was the tile names in the resourses folder
- getting the tiles to be the right size on the board - needed to resize them to the size of the panes not their native size of 8 bits
- Two of the same tokens can be selected in the token dialog
